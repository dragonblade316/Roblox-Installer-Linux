                                 Roblox For Linux 

        This is not a file made by Roblox offcially. It's a custom roblox installer,
        for installing roblox on linux.

        You just need to sit back relax. The script will install roblox on your Linux
        distribution.

        NOTE : This installer only works on Debian Based Distros. For downloading on
        Arch or Red Hat distribution, you need to do it manually.

        Thank you !
